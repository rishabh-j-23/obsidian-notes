- Each device has a link address or [[MAC Address]]
- Devices that directly reachable deices can communicate with [[MAC Address]]
- uses Layer 2 [[Data Link Layer]]'s [[Frames]]
- Each device advertise its presence 
- [[Network Switches]] remembers ports of this devices is at -> !First Optimization
	- This is critical for performance

##### Where link breaks
1. [[MAC Address]] -> unique and random
2. [[Data Links]] dont scale on large network of large devices
	1. This needs a new address system
		- routable one -> [[IP Address]]
