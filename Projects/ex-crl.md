## Functional requirements 
- Store requests => IMP -> figure this out
    - eg, for key login-rishabh => the equivalent request json will be stored
    - utilize cookies
- show time taken to execute and request details
- use $EDITOR to add or edit request json schema
- use `fzf` to navigate through requests
- request data read anytime
    - table for simpler data
- manage environment
- create workflow
    - eg: set login to exec before every req in env
    - should show time for original request not the combined request
- Define cookies?

### TODO
- [X] Implement cookie store
- [ ] remove / from a api endpoint if it exists
- [ ] add option to exclude workflow during exec
## What to use 
- Go
    - Go's built in http lib
    - cobra module
    - encoding/json
- fzf
    - to search for request files
- $EDITOR
- **json based storage of requests locally -> IMP**
    - store in `~/ex-crl`
        - structure:
            - config.json
            - projects
                - [project_name]
                    - projectconfig.json
                    - headers.json
                    - workflow.json
                        - exec: array[request]
                                - [request] : json
                                - exec: [bool] 
                                    - to exec this request or not
                    - requests
                        - [request].json
- [request].json structure
    - http-method: [get | put | post ...]
    - request-data
    - headers

## Commands  
- `ex-crl init [project-name]`
    - init the project with some default config
- `ex-crl exec [request]`
    - no flag
        - parse [request].json file
            - get headers
            - get data
            - get cookie
            - exec the data
            - measure time
            - display the data
    - -w, --workflow
        - before every request `ex-crl exec` the request in this workflow file
- -v, --verbose flag
    - shows everything that is being executed basically all logs
- `ex-crl env` 
    - use [env] to switch active project environment
- `ex-crl list` 
    - list to show available requests in table form
